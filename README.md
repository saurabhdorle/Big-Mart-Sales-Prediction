# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store.

This problem is solved using three approaches:
1) Linear regression approach, where MSE(Mean Square Error) is 1193
2) Decision Tree Approach, Where this model gave the MSE of 1174
3) XGBoost approach, and this model gave the best performance as MSE is 1151
